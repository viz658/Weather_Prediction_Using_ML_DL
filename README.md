## Weather Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project contains code  for the implementation of a weather forecasting model using deep learning techniques.

---

### Datasets

1. **Jena Climate Dataset**: A weather forecasting dataset with over 450,000 entries of climate data. [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/jena-climate).
2. **Seattle Weather Dataset**: A smaller weather dataset containing weather records from Seattle, file is named `seattle-weather.csv`.

### Deep Learning techniques used

- **RNN Model**: Designed for time-series regression on the Jena  and Seattle dataset to predict temperature.
- **FFNN Model**: Used for classification tasks with the Seattle dataset to predict weather categories.

### Notebooks

- **RNN_Jena_Climate_dataset.ipynb**: Implementation of the RNN model for time-series regression tasks on the Jena dataset.
- **RNN_Seattle_Dataset.ipynb**: Implementation of the RNN model for time-series regression task on the Seattle dataset.
- **Seattle_Weather_FFNN.ipynb**: Implementation of the FFNN model for classification tasks on the Seattle dataset, it includes baseline benchmarking machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost.
